    <h1>Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred<br />
      to a printed document that contains<br />
      spaces for you to fill in information.
    </h1>
    <h4><br />
      HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different<br />
      elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to<br />
      your site.

    <h4><br />
      Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or<br />
      you need to create more complicated insurance applications,<br />
      HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from<br />
      your users. In this chapter you will learn:<br />

    <h1>Why Forms?</h1>
    <h2>The best known form on the web is probably<br />the search box that sits right in the middle of<br />Google's homepage.</h2>
    <p>In addition to enabling users to<br />
      search, forms also allow users<br />
      to perform other functions<br />
      online.
    </p>
    <p>You will see forms<br />
      when registering as a member<br />
      of a website, when shopping<br />
      online, and when signing up for<br />
      newsletters or mailing lists.

    <h1>Form Control</h1>
    <p>There are several types of form controls that<br />
      you can use to collect information from visitors<br />
      to your site.
    </p>

    <h2>1. ADDING TEXT:</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Text input (single-line)</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Used for a single line of text such<br />
      as email addresses and names.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Password input</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like a single line text box but it<br />
      masks the characters entered.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Text area (multi-line)</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For longer areas of text, such as<br />
      messages and comments.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Making Choices:</h2>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Radio buttons</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For use when a user must select<br />
      one of a number of options
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Checkboxes</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a user can select and<br />
      unselect one or more options
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Drop-down boxes</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a user must pick one of a<br />
      number of options from a list.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Submitting Forms:</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Submit buttons</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To submit data from your form<br />
      to another web page.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Image buttons</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Similar to submit buttons but<br />
      they allow you to use an image.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Uploading Files:</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>File upload</h3>
        </li>

    <h1>How Forms Work</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A user fills in a form and then presses a button<br />
        to submit the information to the server.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The name of each form<br />
        control is sent to the<br />
        server along with the<br />
        value the user enters or<br />
        selects.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The server processes<br />
        the information using a<br />
        programming language<br />
        such as PHP, C#, VB.net,<br />
        or Java. It may also store<br />
        the information in a<br />
        database.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The server creates a new<br />
        page to send back to the<br />
        browser based on the<br />
        information received.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A form may have several form controls, each<br />
      gathering different information. The server<br />
      needs to know which piece of inputted data<br />
      corresponds with which form element.
    </h2>

    <p>To differentiate between various pieces of inputted data, information<br />
      is sent from the browser to the server using name/value pairs.
    </p>

    <p>In this example, the form asks for the visitor's username and also for their<br />
      favorite jazz musician.
    </p>

    <p>The name/value pairs sent to the server are:<br />
      You should never change the name of a form control in a page unless<br />
      you know that the code on the server will understand this new value.
    </p>

    <p><br /><strong>username</strong>=<em>Ivy</em></p>
    <p>If the form control allows the<br />
      user to enter text, then the value<br />
      of the form control is whatever<br />
      the user has typed in.
    </p>

    <p><br /><strong>vote</strong>=<em>Herbie</em></p>
    <p>If the form control allows you<br />
      to choose from a fixed set of<br />
      answers (e.g. radio buttons,<br />
      checkboxes or a drop down list),<br />
      the web page author will add<br />
      code that gives each option an<br />
      automatic value.
    </p>

    <h6>You should never change the name of a form control in a page unless<br />
      you know that the code on the server will understand this new value.
    </h6>

    <h1>Form Structure</h1>

    <h2>< form ></h2>
    <p>
      Form controls live inside a element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.
    </p>

    <h2>action</h2>
    <p>
      Every element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
    </p>

    <h2>method</h2>
    <p>
      Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        short forms (such as search boxes)
      </li>
      <li>
        when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database) <br>
        This is where the form controls will appear. <br>
        HTML Form Structure With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. <br>
        As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        allows users to upload a file
      </li>
      <li>
        is very long
      </li>
      <li>
        contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords)
      </li>
      <li>
        adds information to, or deletes information from, a database If the method attribute is not used, <br>
        the form data will be sent using the get method.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>id</h2>
    <p>
      We look at the id attribute on page 183, but the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page <br>
      (and is often used by scripts - such as those that check you have entered information into fields that require values).
    </p>

<h1>TEXT INPUT</h1>
<h2>< input ></h2>
<p><br />The &lt;input&gt; element is used<br />to create several different form<br />controls. The value of the type<br />attribute determines what kind<br />of input they will be creating.</p>
<h2><br />type="text"</h2>
<p><br />When the type attribute has a<br />value of text, it creates a singleline<br />text input.</p>
<h2><br />name</h2>
<p><br />When users enter information<br />into a form, the server needs to<br />know which form control each<br />piece of data was entered into.<br />(For example, in a login form, the<br />server needs to know what has<br />been entered as the username<br />and what has been given as the<br />password.) Therefore, each form<br />control requires a name attribute.<br />The value of this attribute<br />identifies the form control and is<br />sent along with the information<br />they enter to the server.</p>
<h2><br />maxlength</h2>
<p><br />You can use the maxlength<br />attribute to limit the number<br />of characters a user may enter<br />into the text field. Its value is the<br />number of characters they may<br />enter. For example, if you were<br />asking for a year, the maxlength<br />attribute could have a value of 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>size</h2>
<p><br />The size attribute should not<br />be used on new forms. It was<br />used in older forms to indicate<br />the width of the text input<br />(measured by the number of<br />characters that would be seen).<br />For example, a value of 3 would<br />create a box wide enough to<br />display three characters<br />(although a user could enter<br />more characters if they desired).<br />In any new forms you write,<br />CSS should be used to control<br />the width of form elements.<br />The size attribute is only<br />mentioned here because you<br />may come across it when looking<br />at older code.</p>
