    <h1>Why Forms?</h1>
    <h2>The best known form on the web is probably<br />the search box that sits right in the middle of<br />Google's homepage.</h2>
    <p>In addition to enabling users to<br />
      search, forms also allow users<br />
      to perform other functions<br />
      online.
    </p>
    <p>You will see forms<br />
      when registering as a member<br />
      of a website, when shopping<br />
      online, and when signing up for<br />
      newsletters or mailing lists.
