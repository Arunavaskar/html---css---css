      <h1>Writing links</h1>
      <p>Links are created using < a > element. Users can click on anything that is in between a opening < a > and closing </ a > tag. <br>
        you add the link to which you want the user to be directed after the click to the <em>href</em> attribute. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="http://www.google.co.in">Google</a>
        Here the Google text is highlighted by blue color stating that it is a link.
        *You should see the code for the link for better understanding by right clicking on the link and selecting inspect element.

      <h1>Linking to other sites</h1>
      <h2>"< a >"</h2>
      <p>As we discussed previously, a for anchor tag is used to create a link where the link for the site is going <br>
        be in the href attribute. <br>
        When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the absoulte URL of that site. <br>
        Browsers by default will show links in blue with underline. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>
      </p>

      <br>

      <h1>Linking to other pages on the same site</h1>
      <h2>"< a >"</h2>
      <p>When you are linking a to other site that are on the same site, you don't need to use <br>
        the full domain name of the site, instead you can just use <strong>relative</strong> URL. <br> <br>

        For this relative URL method to work, all the sites that are to be linked to the same page via anchor tags, <br>
        needs to be in the same folder. <br> <br>

        If you have different sites in different folders, you need to use there directories in place of the href attribute. <br> <br>

        <strong>RELATIVE URLS</strong> <br>
        In short, when you have all the sites in the same folder, you can just enter the name of the site document like <br>
        <a href="HTML List.html">HTML List.html</a>. when you click on this link, you will be direcvted to the site that is on the same folder.
      </p>

      <h1>Email links</h1>
      <h2>mailto:</h2>
      <p>To create a link that starts up the user's mail service app to send a mail to someone specific, <br>
        you need to use malito: in the start of the href attribute value and then it is followed by the the email adress that you want to <br>
        mail to. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="mailto:arunavaskar@gmail.com">contact me</a> via mail! <br>
        Here if you click on the link this willl start up your mail service app to maill me as i given my maill adress after the mailto: value <br>
        in that href attribute.
