      <h1>Writing links</h1>
      <p>Links are created using < a > element. Users can click on anything that is in between a opening < a > and closing </ a > tag. <br>
        you add the link to which you want the user to be directed after the click to the <em>href</em> attribute. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="http://www.google.co.in">Google</a>
        Here the Google text is highlighted by blue color stating that it is a link. <br>
        <strong><em>*You should see the code for the link for better understanding by right clicking on the link and selecting inspect element.</em></strong>
      </p>

      <h1 id="Linking_to_other_sites">Linking to other sites</h1>
      <h2>"< a >"</h2>
      <p>As we discussed previously, a for anchor tag is used to create a link where the link for the site is going <br>
        be in the href attribute. <br>
        When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the absoulte URL of that site. <br>
        Browsers by default will show links in blue with underline. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>
      </p>

      <h1 id="Linking_to_other_pages_on_the_same_site">Linking to other pages on the same site</h1>
      <h2>"< a >"</h2>
      <p>When you are linking a to other site that are on the same site, you don't need to use <br>
        the full domain name of the site, instead you can just use <strong>relative</strong> URL. <br> <br>

        For this relative URL method to work, all the sites that are to be linked to the same page via anchor tags, <br>
        needs to be in the same folder. <br> <br>

        If you have different sites in different folders, you need to use there directories in place of the href attribute. <br> <br>

        <strong>RELATIVE URLS</strong> <br>
        In short, when you have all the sites in the same folder, you can just enter the name of the site document like <br>
        <a href="HTML List.html">HTML List.html</a>. when you click on this link, you will be direcvted to the site that is on the same folder.

      <h1 id="Email_links">Email links</h1>
      <h2>mailto:</h2>
      <p>To create a link that starts up the user's mail service app to send a mail to someone specific, <br>
        you need to use malito: in the start of the href attribute value and then it is followed by the the email adress that you want to <br>
        mail to. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="mailto:arunavaskar@gmail.com">contact me</a> via mail! <br>
        Here if you click on the link this willl start up your mail service app to maill me as i given my maill adress after the mailto: value <br>
        in that href attribute.
      </p>

      <h1 id="Opening_links_in_a_new_window">Opening links in a new window</h1>
      <h2>target</h2>
      <p>If you want to open the link to a new window, you can use this target="_blank" after adding the link in a quote as a value to the  href attribute in the < a > tag. <br>
        One of the major reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened is simply because <br>
        opening a link on the same page might distract the user from the main page and opening in a new page <br>
        helps the user to comeback to the main page easily. Generally avoid opening a link in a new window but <br>
        if you do, try to inform the user that link will be opened in a new window after being clicked. <br> <br>

        Like:- <a href="HTML Structure.html" target="_blank">HTML structure</a>(Opens in a new window) <br>
        <strong><em>*you are highly advised to inspect this example link element above by right clicking on it and selecting inspect element for better understanding oohow this code works!</em></strong>

      <h1>Linking to a specific part of a same page</h1>
      <p>At the top of a page you might want to add a list of contents that the user might find throught out the page. <br>
        Now if that list items could actually be clikable links that would move the page to that specific part of the content <br>
        in that page??!! Or for a different scenario there is a button at the bottom of the page that states "got to the top" so that <br>
        when the user clicks the button or the link, the page just moves to the top of it??!!! <br> <br>
        This is why this idea of linking a specific part of a same page is valuable! <br> <br>

        Like:- <br>
      Table of content <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#Linking_to_other_sites">Linking to other sites</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Linking_to_other_pages_on_the_same_site">Linking to other pages on the same site</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Email_links">Email links</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Opening_links_in_a_new_window">Opening links in a new window</a></li>
      </ol> <br> <br>

      <p><a href="#top">Go to top</a></p>

      <h1>Linking to a specific part of another page</h1>
      <p>If you want to link to specific part of a different site, you can use the same technique. <br>
        You have to make sure that the part of that different site that you want tp link needs to have a id. <br> <br>

        Like:-
