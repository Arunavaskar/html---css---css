    <h1>Choosing Images for your site</h1>
    <h2>A picture can say a thousand words and great images help <br>
      make the difference between a average looking site and a more engaging one!
    </h2>
    <p>Images can be used to set the tone for a site. There are a lots of companies that sell <br>
      <strong>stock images</strong>. These are images you pay to use. <br>
      You will have to always remember the fact that images online are always copyrighted and <br>
      using them without proper owner consent or any permit can lead to legal issues with the owner <br>
      of that image. <br> <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Things to remember:</h3>
    <h3>Images should...</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>be relevant</li>
      <li>convey information</li>
      <li>be instantly recognizable</li>
      <li>fit the color palette</li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <h3>Some stock Photo providers...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com">istockphoto</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.gettyimages.com">gettyimages</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.veer.com">veer</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.sxc.hu">sxc.hu</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.fotolia.com">fotolia</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Storing Images on your site</h1>
    <h2>I you are building a site from scratch, <br>
      it is best to keep all the images that the site uses in a folder as a <em>backup</em>!
    </h2>
    <p>As a website grows, keeping all the images in a separate folder helps <br>
      understanding how the website is Organizedd. <br> <br>

      On a big site you might want to create sub folders for different topic based images, <br>
      Like, images for logos and buttons might sit in a folder like <em>interface</em>, <br>
      product photograph might sit in a page called <em>products</em>, and images related to <br>
      news might sit in a folder called <em>news</em>.
    </p>

    <h1>Adding images</h1>
    <h2>"< img >"</h2>
    <p>To add an image to the website this element is used! <br>
      < img > this element hasa no closing tag, which means that this is <br>
      an empty tag. It must carry the following attributes... <br>
      src, alt and title.
    </p>
    <h3>src</h3>
    <p>This simply tells the browser where to find the picture! <br>
      source like a web adress for the imaage location or local <br>
      directories location for the image.
    </p>
    <h3>alt</h3>
    <p>alternate text description for the image for the user <br>
      if the image is not displayed properly.
    </p>
    <h3>title</h3>
    <p>You can use the title attribute with the <br>
      < img > tag to give a more detailed description about the image. <br>
      Most browsers will display the title attribute contents when the <br>
      user hovers the mouse button over the image.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like:- <br>
      <img src="https://www.image.ie/images/no-image.png" alt="Image of a imgae" title="This is a Image"> <br>
      Things to notice here is that we use img tag to add the image, src attribute contains the source adress of this image, <br>
      alt attribute contains the alternate description for the image if the image do not render, and title attribute is <br>
      for displaying a short describtion of the image when user hovers the mouse pointer above the image! <br>
      <strong><em>*You should see the code for the link for better understanding by right clicking on the link and selecting inspect element.</em></strong>
    </p>

    <h1>Height and Width of images</h1>
    <p>You will often see < img > using two <br>
      other attributes as well!
    </p>
    <h2>Height</h2>
    <p>This specifies the Height of the image in pixels.</p>
    <h2>Width</h2>
    <p>This specifies the width of the image in pixels.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Images take longer to load compared to HTML code which takes up the rest of the page. <br>
      So it is better to specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the page <br>
      leaving the right ammount of space for the image to load. <br> <br>

      Now a days CSS properties are used instaed of HTML to specify size of a image. <br>
      we will learn about this properties in <a href="#">this chapter</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like:- <br>
      <img src="https://www.image.ie/images/no-image.png" alt="Image of a imgae" title="This is a Image" height="100" width="100"> <br>
      Things to notice here is that we use Height attribute to define the image's height to 100 pixels and <br>
      width to define the image's width to 100 pixels. <br>
      <strong><em>*You should see the code for the link for better understanding by right clicking on the link and selecting inspect element.</em></strong>
    </p>

    <h1>Where to place images in your page?</h1>
    <h2>There are three possibly golden positions to remember while considering adding image/images in your page.</h2>
    <p>Where an image is placed in a page largely effects how the content <br>
      in that page is going to be displayed. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h1>Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally</h1>
    <h2>align</h2>
    <p>The allign attribute was commonly used to indicate how  <br>
      the other parts of page would go around an image. <br>
      This feature has been removed from HTML and users should <br>
      use the CSS to control the allignment of images. more about it in <a href="#">here</a>. <br> <br>

      You are seeing anything about it here because you may eventually come across this attribute in <br>
      older codes, and some visual editors still adds this attribute when users work with imgae addition using img tags. <br>

      align attribute can take these Horizontal value..
    </p>
    <h2>left: align</h2>
    <p>This alligns the image to the left allowing the text to flow around it's right hand side.</p>
    <h2>Right: align</h2>
    <p>This aligns the texts to the right allowing the text to flow around it's left hand side.</p>
