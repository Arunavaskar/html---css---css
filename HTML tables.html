<h1>There are several types of information  <br>
    that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: <br>
    Stock results, Stock reports, Train time tables.

<h2>When representing information in a table, <br>
    you need to think of a grid made up of rows and columns <br>
    (kind of like spreadsheet). We learn to...

<h1>What is a table?</h1>
<h2>A table represents information in a grid format. <br>
    Example of a table Includes TV schedules, sports results, financial reports.
</h2>
<p>Grids allows us to understand complex data <br>
  by referencing information on two axes.
</p>
<p>Each block in a grid is referred to as <strong>table cells</strong>. <br>
  In <strong>HTML</strong> a table is written row by row.
</p>

<h1>Basic Table Structure</h1>
<h2>"< table >"</h2>
<p>The Table element is used  create a table. <br>
  The content of a table is written row by row.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>"< tr >"</h2>
<p>You can indicate the starting of a table row by <br>
   using this opening tag(tr stands for table row). <br> <br>

   It is followed by one or more < td > elements(one for <br>
  each cell in that row). <br> <br>

  At the end of the row you use a closing </ tr > tag.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>"< td >"</h2>
<p>Each cell of a table is represented using td element(td stands for <br>
  data). <br> <br>

  at the end of each cell you use a closing </ td > tag. <br>
  *Some Browsers automatically display borders around a table. <br>
  *We will learn how to control those borders using CSS <a href="#">here</a>. <br> <br>

  Like:- <br>
  <h3>Here is a how a table looks like, rows and columns.</h3>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>first row column 1</td>
      <td>first row column 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>second row column 1</td>
      <td>second row column 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<h1>Table Headings</h1>
<h2>< th ></h2>
<p>To create a table heading, you need to use this element. <br>
   This element is just like td element just that it's purpose is to represent <br>
   heading for a column or a row. th stands for table headings.<br> <br>

   Even if a cell has no content, you sould still use a < td > or a <br>
   < th > element to represent the presence of a empty cell other wise <br>
   that table won't be rendered correctly. <br> <br>

   You can use the scope attribute to the < th > element to indicate <br>
   if the heading is a column or a row. This attribute can take <br>
   row to indicate if the heading is for a row or col to indicate if the <br>
   heading is for a col. <br> <br>

   browsers normaly display content of a th element in bold and in the middle of a cell.
