    <h3>There is a lots of occasions when we need to use lists. <br> HTML provides us with three different types:</h3>
    <!-- ul element suggests that the following list items are going to be unordered. -->
    <ul>
    <!-- li elements inside the ul element suggests that the following content is going to be the unordered lists items. -->
    <li>
      <strong>Ordered lists</strong> are lists where each item in the list is numbered. <br>
      for example the list might be a set of steps that starts and ends with 1 to some number. <br>
      those numbers can be like 1 or romans!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unordered lists</strong> begins and ends with bullets rather than charecters that indicate oreder!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Definition lists</strong> arre made up of terms along with there definitions following them.
    </li>
  </ul>
