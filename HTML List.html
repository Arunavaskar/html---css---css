    <h3>There is a lots of occasions when we need to use lists. <br> HTML provides us with three different types:</h3>
    <!-- ul element suggests that the following list items are going to be unordered. -->
    <ul>
    <!-- li elements inside the ul element suggests that the following content is going to be the unordered lists items. -->
    <li>
      <strong>Ordered lists</strong> are lists where each item in the list is numbered. <br>
      for example the list might be a set of steps that starts and ends with 1 to some number. <br>
      those numbers can be like 1 or romans!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unordered lists</strong> begins and ends with bullets rather than charecters that indicate oreder!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Definition lists</strong> are made up of terms along with there definitions following them.
    </li>
  </ul>

   <h1>Ordered List</h1>
   <h2>"< li >"</h2>
   <p>Each item in the list is placed between an opening "< li >" aand a closing "</ li >" tag.(li stands for list items.) <br>
     Browsers indent lists by default.
   </p>

   <br>

   <h2>"< ol >"</h2>
   <p>The Ordered list is created with this element <br>
     Sometimes you will see type of attribute used with the ol element to specify the type numbering like <br>
     numbers, letters or romans. It is better to use CSS list-style-type property covered on <a href="#">page SOMETHING.</a> <br> <br>

     Like:- <ol>
       <li>oredered list 1</li>
       <li>ordered list 2</li>
       <li>oredered list 3</li>
     </ol>
   </p>

   <br>

   <h2>"< ul >"</h2>
   <p>This element is used to create unordered list. <br>
     Sometimes you will see type of attribute used with the ol element to specify the type numbering like <br>
     numbers, letters or romans. It is better to use CSS list-style-type property covered on <a href="#">page SOMETHING.</a> <br> <br>

     Like:- <ul>
       <li>unoredered list 1</li>
       <li>unordered list 2</li>
       <li>unoredered list 3</li>
     </ul>
   </p>

   <h1>Defininition List</h1>
   <h2>"< dl >"</h2>
   <p>The definition list is created using this element and is usually <br>
     used to create list consisting of terms following there definitions. <br>
     Inside dl element you will find dt and dd element.
   </p>

   <br>

   <h3>   "< dt >"</h3>
   <p>   This element is used to contain the term being described(the definition term)</p>

   <br>

   <h3>   "< dd >"</h3>
   <p>   This element is used to contain the definition.
   </p>
   <p>   Sometimes you might see two terms containing one or more definitions or <br>
         one term containing more than one definition. <br> <br>
         <!-- definition lists -->
         Like:- <dl class="">

           <!-- definitions term -->
           <dt>Term 1</dt>
           <!-- definition data -->
           <dd>This is the part where the definition of the term is described!</dd>

           <!-- definition data -->
           <dt>Term 2</dt>
           <dt>Term 2 no.2</dt>
           <!-- definition data -->
           <dd>This is the part where the definition of the term is described! 2.0</dd>

           <!-- definition data -->
           <dt>Term 3</dt>
           <!-- definition data -->
           <dd>This is the part where the definition of the term is described! 3.0</dd>
           <dd>more than one definition to one term!</dd>
         </dl>
   </p>

   <h1>Nested List</h1>
   <p>You can nest another list inside a list. This called nested list. <br>
     Browsers ususally indent the nested list more than a normal list and <br>
     for unordered lists browsers may change the bullet type to something different too. <br> <br>
     <!-- nested list -->
     Like:- <ol>
       <li>ordered parent List no 1</li>
       <li>oredered parent List no 2</li>
       <ul>
         <li>unoredered child list 1</li>
         <li>unoredered child list 2</li>
         <ul>
           <li>unoredered child's child list 1</li>
           <li>unoredered child's child list 2</li>
           <ol>
             <li>oredered child's child's child list 1</li>
             <li>oredered child's child's child list 2</li>
           </ol>
         </ul>
       </ul>
     </ol>
  </p>
