    <h3>There is a lots of occasions when we need to use lists. <br> HTML provides us with three different types:</h3>
    // li suggests this follwing content is going to be lists
    <li>
    // ul inside this li element suggests that the following list items are going to be unordered.
    <ul>
      <strong>Ordered lists</strong> are lists where each item in the list is numbered. <br>
      for example the list might be a set of steps that starts and ends with 1 to some number. <br>
      those numbers can be like 1 or romans!
    </ul>
    <ul>
